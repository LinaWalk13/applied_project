      <section id="about">
        <h2>About us </h2>
        <p> Our website is created by two students of Cognitive Science at Aarhus University, who are passionate about improving the learning experience for students. We recognize that lectures can be challenging to navigate, especially with the overwhelming amount of information presented in a short period. Therefore, we have developed this platform as a resource to help students enhance their learning experience by providing evidence-based principles from cognitive science and design. Our aim is to empower teachers and fellow students with the tools and knowledge needed to create engaging and effective presentations and study materials that maximize the takeaway from lectures. By sharing our expertise, we hope to create a community of like-minded individuals who are dedicated to improving the learning experience for themselves and others.</p>
