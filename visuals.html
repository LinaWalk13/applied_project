    <h1>Use visuals</h1>
    <p class="two">Include a variety of visual material to support your presentation. These can be graphs, flow charts, pictures and other kinds of visual material that include informtaion relevant to the contetn of the verbally transmitted message. </p>
<h2>Cognitive psychology theories supporting this point</h2>
<h3>Dual-channel assumption</h3>
<p class="three">We possess two separate systems for the processing of information - a verbal and a non-verbal system, they are functionally different but interconnected. 
  The verbal channel is responsible for language and words, the non-verbal channel is responsible for all sensory inputs, including visual information. 
   </p>
<p class="three"> By supporting a verbal presentation with visual information, both of these channels can be activated. A complete understanding and representation of the information is formed when the two processing systems are combined. This happens via referential connections, links that allow information to be transferred from one channel to the other. </p>
<p class="three">Visuals are particularly important because of our brainâ€™s enhanced processing of visual information compared to text-based information. 
  Thus, incorporating visuals in a presentation can significantly increase the speed and efficiency with which the audience processes the information.
