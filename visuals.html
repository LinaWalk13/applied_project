    <h1>Use visuals</h1>
    <p class="two">Include a variety of visual material to support your presentation. These can be graphs, flow charts, pictures and other kinds of visual material that include informtaion relevant to the content of the verbally transmitted message. </p>
    <h2>Cognitive psychology theories supporting this point</h2>
<h3>Dual-channel assumption</h3>
<p class="three">We possess two separate systems for the processing of information - a verbal and a non-verbal system, they are functionally different but interconnected. 
  The verbal channel is responsible for language and words, the non-verbal channel is responsible for all sensory inputs, including visual information. 
  <br/>
  By supporting a verbal presentation with visual information, both of these channels can be activated. A complete understanding and representation of the information is formed when the two processing systems are combined. This happens via referential connections, links that allow information to be transferred from one channel to the other.

   <h3>Working memory</h3>
<p class="three"> A similar structure has been attributed to our working memory. Working memory is a crucial cognitive system responsible for temporarily storing and manipulating information. It has been divided into two distinct components: the phonological loop, which deals with auditory information, and the visuospatial sketchpad, which handles visual information. Both components have limited capacities, and the central executive, which acts as the control center, translates information between the two while also maintaining its own storage. 
  The way information is presented can have a significant impact on how much of it can be retained and processed by the audience. This is where the use of visual information becomes essential. Visuals have been shown to reduce <a href="text.html", style="font-size: 22px;">cognitive load</a>, allowing for faster and more efficient processing of information. Visulas are also more easily encoded, organized, and retrieved from memory compared to text-based information, making them a powerful tool for creating engaging and memorable presentations.
