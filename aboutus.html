    <h1>About us </h1>
    <p class="three" >  Behind Cognitive Slides, we are two Bachelorâ€™s students studying Cognitive Science at Aarhus University. Like many other students, we have felt frustrated by sitting in lectures that are accompanied by poorly designed slideshows and ineffective visual aids. <br>

      As students in a field that deals with the human mind, it surprises us that not more attention is put towards creating presentations that are optimal for learning and retention.  <br>
      
      That is why we decided to go on a mission to help professors and teachers at universities create better visual presentations so that students can benefit from these more effective presentations,ultimately enhancing the learning experience. <br>
      
      We believe that by using evidence-based concepts and design principles that orginiate from theories in Cognitive Psychology, we can help elevate the quality of university lectures.  </p>
