    <h1>About us </h1>
    <p class="three" >  Behind Cognitive Slides, we are two Bachelor’s students studying Cognitive Science at Aarhus University. Like many other students, we have felt frustrated when sitting through lectures with poorly designed slideshow presentations and ineffective visual aids. <br>

      As students in a field that deals with the human mind, it surprises us that not more attention is put towards creating presentations that are optimal for learning and retention.  <br>
      
      That is why we decided to go on a mission to help professors and teachers at universities create better visual presentations that provide students with a better learning experience. <br>
      
      We believe that by using evidence-based concepts and design principles based in Cognitive Psychology, we can help elevate the quality of university lectures. Hopefully, these concepts can ultimately improve not only the experience but also the students’ learning.  </p>
