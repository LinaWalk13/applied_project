      Break down the content of the lecture into salient points and provide the student with a take-away. <br>
      In the beginning of the lecture, the purpose of the lecture as well as the content’s link to former and further topics can be stated. To stimulate the student’s focused attention, it is helpful to specify what is expected to be learned from the lecture.
