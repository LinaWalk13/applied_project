    <h1>Summaries</h1>
    <p class="two">Break down the content of the lecture into salient points and provide the student with a takeaway. Ideally, the focuse points of the lecture are presented in the beginning, between subtopics and in the end. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>How can this be done?</h2>

        <p class="three"> 
          <strong style="text-shadow: 0 0 1px #000;"> In the beginning of the lecture, stating the  </strong>  <br>
          &nbsp 1. the purpose of the lecture <br>
          &nbsp 2. the content’s link to former and further topics<br>
          &nbsp 3. knowledge that is expected to be taken away from the lecture<br>

          <strong style="text-shadow: 0 0 1px #000;"> Using midway summaries that </strong>  <br>
          &nbsp 1. are built on the main elements of the lecture <br>
          &nbsp 2. review and repeat the information presented in a condensed manner<br>
          
          <strong style="text-shadow: 0 0 1px #000;"> Ending with </strong>  <br>
          &nbsp 1. a summary of the salient points
          </p>


    <h2>How does this help my students?</h2>
    <p class="three"> 
      1. Structure can focus the student's attention on salient points <br>
      2. Structure can guide note-taking <br>
      3. Midway summaries can provide a rest point to digest the information that have been delivered so far<br>
      4. Lecture slides and lecture videos can be used to study and prepare for exams 
      </p>
    <h2>Cognitive psychology theories supporting this point</h2>
    <h3>Chunking</h3>
    <p class="three">In cognitive psychology, chunking is the process of combining individual information into meaningful units, chunks. The elements that make up a chunk have strong associations to each other, and the number of elements in a chunk can differ. 
      The process of chunking has been established as a key process in humans cognition and memory, with chunks being the appropriate measure of the capacity of human memory. Thus, when pieces of information are associated in a meaningful way, encoding can be enhanced and made more efficient. 
    </p>
    <h3>Focused attention</h3>
    <p class="three"> Focused attention is a mechanism in the early stages of information processing. It is the ability to intentionally concentrate on a target stimuli, or in the context of lectures, on target information. Attention can be divided into stimuli-driven and goal-directed attention. While stimulus-driven attention is captured by the features of a stimuli such as a high-pitched sound, goal-directed attention functions on the basis of cues, these being either internal or external instructions. <br>
      Therefore, stating the salient points of a lecture provides the students with cues to where the mental focus should be directed, which is essential for eliciting the processing of information and storing it in memory.
