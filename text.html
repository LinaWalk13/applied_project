    <h1>Minimize text</h1>

    <p class="two">There should be a minimal amount of text on your slides. Text should ideally only be a support to your verbal presentation to make the presentation easier to follow.  <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Cognitive psychology theories supporting this point</h2>
    <h3>Cognitive load theory</h3>
    <p class="three">
      <strong style="text-shadow: 0 0 1px #000;"> The redundancy effect </strong>  <br>
      The redundancy effect states that presenting the same information in multiple formats can create unnecessary cognitive load and potentially interfere with learning. Redundant information means more information to process to gain an understanding of the material. <br>
    

      <strong style="text-shadow: 0 0 1px #000;"> Split attention theory </strong>  <br>
      Split attention theory states that if learners have to split their attention between different sources of information, it can interfere with their learning. This effect can occur if the student has to read something and take in a visual to fully understand a concept. Studies show that avoiding this effect is better for learning and avoiding a heavy cognitive load. <br>
      For concepts that cannot stand alone, visuals can be a great tool to accompany speech. This aligns with the dual channel theory that shows how working memory consists of separate visual and auditory channels.

    <h2>How can this be done?</h2>

      <p class="three"> 
        <strong style="text-shadow: 0 0 1px #000;"> When creating visual presentations </strong>  <br>
        &nbsp 1. avoid presenting the same information both visually as text and verbally if possible <br>
        &nbsp 2  minimize large amounts of text and reading directly from the slides<br>
        &nbsp 3. use visuals such as graphs and illustrations to help make a point<br>
        </p>


  <h2>Is text crucial for your presentation?</h2>
  <p class="three"> 
    If there is a need for text for the students to use the slide at a later point in time, one idea is to send out a separate document with the text you were planning on including in the presentation. A good rule of thumb is that a visual presentation accompanying your verbal presentation should not resemble a document.
